Requirements and Dependency:

Install PyTorch with CUDA (for GPU)



1. MLP on MNIST datasets:

Run the corresponding bash scripts in './Mnist/experiments/'
Note that you need to specifiy your data dir by revising '--dataset-root=/raid/dd/'

2. ImageNet experiments:

Run the corresponding bash scripts in './ImageNet/experiments/'
Note that you need to specifiy your data dir by revising '--dataset-root=/raid/dd/imageNet/input_torch/'
