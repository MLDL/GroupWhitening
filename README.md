# GroupWhitening


1. The implementation of our GW modules (by ZCA whitening or ItN whitening) are in the directory: ‘./classification/extension/normalization/’ 

2. We apply our modules on classification (‘./classification/’) and object detection tasks (‘/maskrcnn_debug/’), as described in our paper. 

Note that the code repo ‘./classification/’ is based on the [IterNorm project](https://github.com/huangleiBuaa/IterNorm), and the code repo ‘/maskrcnn_debug/’ is based on the [maskrcnn project](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark).

Please follow the file 'readme.txt' in './classification/' to validate the classification experiments.
 Please follow the files 'README.md' and 'INSTALL.md' in  ‘/maskrcnn_debug/’ to validate the object detection and instance segmentation experiments.
